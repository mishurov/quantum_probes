# Quantum computing probes

A notebook containing quantum algorithms. At the moment there's only the QFT from cirq's examples.

The idea of working with unitary operators on a complex Hilbert space is tremendously attractive in comparison with the classic gates. I hope that I get a spare time and willingless to make something.
